            <h3>What is PHP?</h3>
            <p>
                PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nice, but what does that mean? An example:
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                <div class="info">
                    <p>Example #1 An introductory example</p>
                </div>
                <div class="example-contents">
                    <code>
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;<br>
                        &lt;html&gt;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Example&lt;/title&gt;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;?php<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!";<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?&gt;<br>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/html&gt;<br>
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does "something" (in this case, output "Hi, I'm a PHP script!"). The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow you to jump into and out of "PHP mode."
            </p>
            <p>
                What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. You can even configure your web server to process all your HTML files with PHP, and then there's really no way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve.
            </p>    
            <p>
                The best things in using PHP are that it is extremely simple for a newcomer, but offers many advanced features for a professional programmer. Don't be afraid reading the long list of PHP's features. You can jump in, in a short time, and start writing simple scripts in a few hours.
            </p>    
            <p>
                Although PHP's development is focused on server-side scripting, you can do much more with it. Read on, and see more in the What can PHP do? section, or go right to the introductory tutorial if you are only interested in web programming.
            </p>

            <h3>What can PHP do?</h3>
            <p>
                Anything. PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting, so you can do anything any other CGI program can do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies. But PHP can do much more.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are three main areas where PHP scripts are used.
            </p>

            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-items">
                    Server-side scripting. This is the most traditional and main target field for PHP. You need three things to make this work: the PHP parser (CGI or server module), a web server and a web browser. You need to run the web server, with a connected PHP installation. You can access the PHP program output with a web browser, viewing the PHP page through the server. All these can run on your home machine if you are just experimenting with PHP programming. See the installation instructions section for more information.
                </li>
                <li class="list-items">
                    Command line scripting. You can make a PHP script to run it without any server or browser. You only need the PHP parser to use it this way. This type of usage is ideal for scripts regularly executed using cron (on *nix or Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows). These scripts can also be used for simple text processing tasks. See the section about Command line usage of PHP for more information.
                </li>
                <li class="list-items">
                    Writing desktop applications. PHP is probably not the very best language to create a desktop application with a graphical user interface, but if you know PHP very well, and would like to use some advanced PHP features in your client-side applications you can also use PHP-GTK to write such programs. You also have the ability to write cross-platform applications this way. PHP-GTK is an extension to PHP, not available in the main distribution. If you are interested in PHP-GTK, visit » its own website.
                </li>
                <li class="list-items">
                    PHP can be used on all major operating systems, including Linux, many Unix variants (including HP-UX, Solaris and OpenBSD), Microsoft Windows, macOS, RISC OS, and probably others. PHP also has support for most of the web servers today. This includes Apache, IIS, and many others. And this includes any web server that can utilize the FastCGI PHP binary, like lighttpd and nginx. PHP works as either a module, or as a CGI processor.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                So with PHP, you have the freedom of choosing an operating system and a web server. Furthermore, you also have the choice of using procedural programming or object oriented programming (OOP), or a mixture of them both.
            </p>

            <p>
                With PHP you are not limited to output HTML. PHP's abilities includes outputting images, PDF files and even Flash movies (using libswf and Ming) generated on the fly. You can also output easily any text, such as XHTML and any other XML file. PHP can autogenerate these files, and save them in the file system, instead of printing it out, forming a server-side cache for your dynamic content.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the strongest and most significant features in PHP is its support for a wide range of databases. Writing a database-enabled web page is incredibly simple using one of the database specific extensions (e.g., for mysql), or using an abstraction layer like PDO, or connect to any database supporting the Open Database Connection standard via the ODBC extension. Other databases may utilize cURL or sockets, like CouchDB.
            </p>

            <p>
                PHP also has support for talking to other services using protocols such as LDAP, IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, HTTP, COM (on Windows) and countless others. You can also open raw network sockets and interact using any other protocol. PHP has support for the WDDX complex data exchange between virtually all Web programming languages. Talking about interconnection, PHP has support for instantiation of Java objects and using them transparently as PHP objects.
            </p>

            <p>
                PHP has useful text processing features, which includes the Perl compatible regular expressions (PCRE), and many extensions and tools to parse and access XML documents. PHP standardizes all of the XML extensions on the solid base of libxml2, and extends the feature set adding SimpleXML, XMLReader and XMLWriter support.
            </p>

            <p>
                And many other interesting extensions exist, which are categorized both alphabetically and by category. And there are additional PECL extensions that may or may not be documented within the PHP manual itself, like » XDebug.
            </p>

            <p>
                As you can see this page is not enough to list all the features and benefits PHP can offer. Read on in the sections about installing PHP, and see the function reference part for explanation of the extensions mentioned here.

            </header>
            <h3>PHP tags</h3>
            <p>When PHP parses a file, it looks for opening and closing tags, which are <em>&lt;?php</em> and <em>?&gt;</em> which tell PHP to start and stop interpreting the code between them. Parsing in this manner allows PHP to be embedded in all sorts of different documents, as everything outside of a pair of opening and closing tags is ignored by the PHP parser.

            <p>
                PHP also allows for short open tag <em>&lt;?</em> (which is discouraged since it is only available if enabled using the short_open_tag <span class="filename">php.ini</span> configuration file directive, or if PHP was configured with the <strong>--enable-short-tags</strong> option).
            </p>
                
            <p>
                If a file is pure PHP code, it is preferable to omit the PHP closing tag at the end of the file. This prevents accidental whitespace or new lines being added after the PHP closing tag, which may cause unwanted effects because PHP will start output buffering when there is no intention from the programmer to send any output at that point in the script.</p>
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-contents">
                    <code>
                        &lt;?php <br>
                        echo "Hello world"; <br>
                        <br>
                        // ... more code <br>
                        <br>
                        echo "Last statement"; <br>
                        <br>
                        // the script ends here with no PHP closing tag <br>
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Escaping from HTML</h3>
            <p>Everything outside of a pair of opening and closing tags is ignored by the PHP parser which allows PHP files to have mixed content. This allows PHP to be embedded in HTML documents, for example to create templates.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-contents">
                    <code>
                        &lt;p&gt;This is going to be ignored by PHP and displayed by the browser.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                        &lt;?php echo 'While this is going to be parsed.'; ?&gt;<br>
                        &lt;p&gt;This will also be ignored by PHP and displayed by the browser.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>This works as expected, because when the PHP interpreter hits the ?> closing tags, it simply starts outputting whatever it finds (except for an immediately following newline - see instruction separation) until it hits another opening tag unless in the middle of a conditional statement in which case the interpreter will determine the outcome of the conditional before making a decision of what to skip over. See the next example.<br>
            Using structures with conditions</p>
            <div class="example">
                <div class="info">Example #1 Advanced escaping using conditions</div>
                <div class="example-contents">
                    <code>
                        &lt;?php if ($expression == true): ?&gt;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will show if the expression is true.<br>
                        &lt;?php else: ?&gt;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise this will show.<br>
                        &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;<br>
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>In this example PHP will skip the blocks where the condition is not met, even though they are outside of the PHP open/close tags; PHP skips them according to the condition since the PHP interpreter will jump over blocks contained within a condition that is not met.</p>
            <p>For outputting large blocks of text, dropping out of PHP parsing mode is generally more efficient than sending all of the text through echo or print.</p>

            <p>In PHP 5, there are up to five different pairs of opening and closing tags available in PHP, depending on how PHP is configured. Two of these, <code class="code">&lt;?php ?&gt;</code> and <code class="code">&lt;script language="php"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;</code>, are always available. There is also the short echo tag <code class="code">&lt;?= ?&gt;</code>, which is always available in PHP 5.4.0 and later.</p>

            <p>The other two are short tags and ASP style tags. As such, while some people find short tags and ASP style tags convenient, they are less portable, and generally not recommended.</p>
            <blockquote class="note">
                <p><strong class="note">Note:</strong></p>
                <p>Also note that if you are embedding PHP within XML or XHTML you will need to use the &lt;?php ?&gt; tags to remain compliant with standards.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>PHP 7 removes support for ASP tags and <code class="code">&lt;script language="php"&gt;</code> tags. As such, we recommend only using &lt;?php ?&gt; and &lt;?= ?&gt; when writing PHP code to maximise compatibility.</p>

                <p>In PHP 5.2 and earlier, the parser does not allow the <em>&lt;?php</em> opening tag to be the only thing in a file. This is allowed as of PHP 5.3 provided there are one or more whitespace characters after the opening tag.</p>

                <p>Starting with PHP 5.4, short echo tag <em>&lt;?=</em> is always recognized and valid, regardless of the short_open_tag setting.</p>

            <h3>Instruction separation</h3>
            <p>As in C or Perl, PHP requires instructions to be terminated with a semicolon at the end of each statement. The closing tag of a block of PHP code automatically implies a semicolon; you do not need to have a semicolon terminating the last line of a PHP block. The closing tag for the block will include the immediately trailing newline if one is present.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-contents">
                    <code>
                        &lt;?php<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo 'This is a test';<br>
                        ?&gt;<br>
                        <br>
                        &lt;?php echo 'This is a test' ?&gt;<br>
                        <br>
                        &lt;?php echo 'We omitted the last closing tag';<br>

                <p>The closing tag of a PHP block at the end of a file is optional, and in some cases omitting it is helpful when using include or require, so unwanted whitespace will not occur at the end of files, and you will still be able to add headers to the response later. It is also handy if you use output buffering, and would not like to see added unwanted whitespace at the end of the parts generated by the included files.</p>

            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>PHP supports 'C', 'C++' and Unix shell-style (Perl style) comments. For example:</p>
            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-contents">
                    <code>
                        &lt;?php<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo 'This is a test'; // This is a one-line c++ style comment<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* This is a multi line comment<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet another line of comment */<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo 'This is yet another test';<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo 'One Final Test'; # This is a one-line shell-style comment<br>
                        ?&gt;
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The "one-line" comment styles only comment to the end of the line or the current block of PHP code, whichever comes first. This means that HTML code after // ... ?> or # ... ?> WILL be printed: ?> breaks out of PHP mode and returns to HTML mode, and // or # cannot influence that. If the asp_tags configuration directive is enabled, it behaves the same with // %> and # %>. However, the <code class="code">&lt/script&gt;</code> tag doesn't break out of PHP mode in a one-line comment.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-contents">
                    <code>
                        &lt;h1&gt;This is an &lt;?php # echo 'simple';?&gt; example&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
                        &lt;p&gt;The header above will say 'This is an  example'.&lt;/p&gt;
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>'C' style comments end at the first */ encountered. Make sure you don't nest 'C' style comments. It is easy to make this mistake if you are trying to comment out a large block of code.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-contents">
                    <code>
                        &lt;?php<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;/*<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo 'This is a test'; /* This comment will cause a problem */<br>

            <p>PHP supports ten primitive types.</p>
            <p>Four scalar types:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-items">boolean</li>
                <li class="list-items">integer</li>
                <li class="list-items">float (floating-point number, aka double)</li>
                <li class="list-items">string</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Four compound types:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-items">array</li>
                <li class="list-items">object</li>
                <li class="list-items">callable</li>
                <li class="list-items">iterable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And finally two special types:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-items">resource</li>
                <li class="list-items">NULL</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This manual also introduces some pseudo-types for readability reasons:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-items">mixed</li>
                <li class="list-items">number</li>
                <li class="list-items">callback (aka callable)</li>
                <li class="list-items">array|object</li>
                <li class="list-items">void</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And the pseudo-variable <code class="code">$...</code>.</p>

            <p>To forcibly convert a variable to a certain type, either cast the variable or use the settype() function on it.</p>
            <p>Note that a variable may be evaluated with different values in certain situations, depending on what type it is at the time. For more information, see the section on Type Juggling. The type comparison tables may also be useful, as they show examples of various type-related comparisons.</p>
